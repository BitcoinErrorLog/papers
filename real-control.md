# Real Control: Ownership as the Power to Destroy Without Consequence

**by John Carvalho**

## Abstract

This paper introduces the concept of **real control** as the foundation of ownership. Real control is defined as the ability to use, alter, or irreversibly destroy an asset without interference or consequence from others. Unlike legal ownership, which depends on institutional enforcement and social recognition, real control reduces ownership to its most direct and testable form: actual, unilateral power. Using examples from history, political theory, and cryptographic systems—especially Bitcoin—we examine ownership in terms of capacity rather than rights, and question the legitimacy of claims untethered from control. We argue that decentralized systems highlight this dynamic more clearly than legacy models, and that understanding ownership through real control has implications for legal theory, system design, and digital sovereignty.

## 1. Introduction

Ownership is traditionally defined in terms of legal rights, moral claims, or institutional consensus. But all of these collapse when tested against material force. Courts can be ignored. Contracts can be unenforced. Consensus can be rejected. What remains—what always remains—is **control**.

This paper proposes that *real control* is the fundamental layer of ownership. It is a factual, not normative, state: if you can act on something—use it, transfer it, destroy it—and no one stops or punishes you, you own it in the most meaningful sense. All other forms of ownership are abstractions resting atop this core condition.

Bitcoin crystallized this for me. If you hold the key, the coins are yours—until you don’t, and they aren’t. This isn’t philosophy; it’s physics.

## 2. Conceptual Framework: Defining Real Control

**Real control** is defined as:

> *The ability to unilaterally act on an asset—including destroying it—without interference or consequence from others.*

This definition has two essential criteria:

- **Action**: The agent can use, modify, or destroy the asset directly.
- **Uncontested**: No one intervenes, retaliates, or enforces consequences.

Real control excludes legal fictions, custodial promises, or social legitimacy. It is tested by action, not by agreement.

To formalize: an agent *A* has real control over asset *X* if and only if:

1. *A* can exercise direct power over *X* (including irreversible destruction);
2. No other agent can prevent or penalize *A* for doing so;
3. Control exists independent of third-party permission or institutional validation.

## 3. Case Studies and Examples

### 3.1 Bitcoin Private Keys

Bitcoin is the most direct example of real control by design. Possession of a private key is possession of the coins. No intermediary or authority can reverse a transaction or freeze the asset. If a user sends their coins to an unspendable address, they are destroyed forever. That’s not a bug; it’s proof of ownership by control.

The phrase "Not your keys, not your coins" captures this truth. It is not legal advice—it is a law of the system.

### 3.2 Historical Spoils and Dominion

Throughout history, ownership often meant nothing more than what one could defend. A warrior’s spoils were his as long as he could keep them. A landholder's estate remained his only if he could repel challengers. Legal title was a luxury; real control was necessity.

### 3.3 Custody and Banking

Modern financial systems mask control behind trust. Funds in a bank account are not under user control; they are IOUs. If the institution freezes the account, your legal title exists, but your ability to act is gone. Real control lies with the custodian.

### 3.4 Adverse Possession and Property Law

Even legal systems quietly admit the primacy of control. Adverse possession laws, which allow squatters to gain legal ownership over time, reward control over formal title. The logic is simple: possession without challenge becomes reality.

## 4. Philosophical and Legal Foundations

### 4.1 Hobbes

In Hobbes’ *Leviathan*, property and justice are meaningless without a sovereign to enforce them. In the state of nature, there is no "mine" or "yours"—only what one can hold. Real control is the only kind of ownership that exists before law.

### 4.2 Locke

Locke's labor theory of property begins with natural rights but acknowledges that enforcement requires consent to government. Property exists by labor, but is secured only by power—initially personal, later social.

### 4.3 Bentham

Jeremy Bentham famously declared: “Property and law are born together and die together.” From this view, property without law is meaningless. Real control, by contrast, exposes property before and beyond law—as a physical relationship, not a social one.

### 4.4 Proudhon

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon’s claim that "Property is theft" reflects discomfort with unchecked control. He distinguishes between *possession* (based on use) and *property* (based on exclusion). Real control aligns more with possession, revealing the political nature of ownership.

### 4.5 Popescu (Bitcoin-Assets IRC, circa 2013–2016)
Bitcoin pioneer Mircea Popescu is believed to have expressed a version of this principle—ownership as the ability to destroy—in early Bitcoin IRC discussions. While not formalized in academic terms, his framing emphasized that control without recourse was the only meaningful expression of property. Though controversial in many respects, this insight foreshadowed the practical realities of ownership in cryptographic systems, where possession and unilateral authority define legitimacy.

## 5. Limitations and Counterpoints

Real control is descriptive, not prescriptive. It explains *what is*, not *what should be*. Several complications arise:

- **Moral Legitimacy**: Control by theft is still control. The framework does not justify it—only describes it.
- **Non-Rival Assets**: Ideas, data, and digital content cannot be destroyed in the same sense as physical objects.
- **Shared Ownership**: Control can be distributed (e.g. multi-signature wallets, corporate governance), complicating attribution.
- **Consequences Aren’t Always Visible**: Laws may not act instantly, but delayed punishment still imposes consequence.

Despite these limits, real control remains a clarifying lens for evaluating ownership claims in high-stakes or adversarial environments.

## 6. Implications for Decentralized Systems

Real control matters most where legal enforcement is weak, untrusted, or unwanted. This makes it particularly relevant to:

- **Cryptocurrency custody**: Systems like Bitcoin enforce ownership via cryptographic possession. Custodial platforms degrade real control.
- **Self-sovereign identity**: Identity systems based on private keys confer real control to individuals.
- **Censorship resistance**: Control of communication or content only exists if users can publish without reprisal.

Designing systems that maximize user control—and minimize forced reliance on third parties—aligns with the principle of real control and offers credible exits from legacy intermediaries.

## 7. Conclusion

Real control is not a metaphor. It is the truest expression of ownership: *act without permission, and it’s yours*. Bitcoin makes this clear, but the principle applies everywhere. Whether in nature, on-chain, or under pressure, only control proves possession. Property rights may be granted, but real control is seized.

When the system fails, when the law breaks down, when enforcement disappears—what you control is what you own. Everything else is a story.
