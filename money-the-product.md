# Money as the Most Demanded Product in a Free Market

## Introduction

Money is often treated as an abstract construct defined by law or authority, but an alternative view rooted in classical and Austrian economics argues that money emerges organically as a market-driven product. In this view, any good that becomes widely demanded and accepted in trade can evolve into money, without requiring top-down decree.

This paper explores the idea of money as the most saleable good—a commodity prized not for its direct use, but for its superior exchangeability. Drawing on theorists such as Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, George Selgin, David Graeber, Nick Szabo, and Eric Voskuil, we analyze how this framing explains both the historical development of money and its relevance to modern digital assets like Bitcoin.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Carl Menger: Money as the Most Saleable Good

Carl Menger, in "On the Origin of Money" (1892), proposed that money arises not from legislation but from the natural evolution of trade. As individuals seek to optimize their ability to trade, they gravitate toward goods that are more "saleable"—that is, easier to exchange.

Over time, some goods become widely accepted as intermediaries not because of any state edict but because everyone finds them convenient. These goods, by their superior liquidity, organically become money.

### Ludwig von Mises: Regression Theorem

Mises added to Menger’s insights by addressing a puzzle: how a new money gains value in the first place. His regression theorem, presented in The Theory of Money and Credit (1912), posits that people can only value a medium of exchange if they have some reference point for its purchasing power in the past.

This seems circular – money has value because we expect others to accept it, and they accept it because they expect yet others to value it – so Mises “breaks” the apparent circularity by regressing to a time when the item was not used as money. At that earliest point, the good’s value was determined solely by its non-monetary uses.

### F.A. Hayek and George Selgin: Currency Competition and Free Banking

Friedrich A. Hayek, in The Denationalisation of Money (1976), advocated allowing private, competing currencies. He argued that money is no different from other commodities and would be better supplied by competition than by state monopoly. In a system of competitive currency issuance, banks or other institutions would issue their own money, and users would be free to choose among them.

George Selgin, a monetary economist, extends this with historical research showing that unregulated, decentralized currency systems often worked well. Free banking theory reinforces the concept that money is a commodity of trade that should be subject to innovation and competition.

### David Graeber: Debt and Social Money

In Debt: The First 5,000 Years, anthropologist David Graeber argues that credit systems preceded monetary barter. He presents evidence from traditional societies showing that exchange was often governed by social credit, and tokens came later.

Even in Graeber’s account, once money is introduced, its value depends on demand. While political structures may shape adoption, market-driven trust ultimately determines longevity.

### Nick Szabo: Collectibles as Proto-Money

Szabo’s Shelling Out describes how humans evolved to use collectibles as early money, emphasizing their desirable properties—durability, portability, scarcity—that made them useful as early stores of value and media of exchange.

Szabo aligns with Menger: money is adopted because it works, and because people find it useful in trade.

### Eric Voskuil: Function Over Form

Voskuil’s Cryptoeconomics emphasizes that money is not defined by essence, but by use. He critiques essentialist narratives like “store of value,” asserting that money only stores purchasing power if people accept it in trade.

From this perspective, Bitcoin is not money because it has scarcity or ideology, but only to the extent that people use it in exchange.

## Bitcoin Culture: A Reality Check

### Store of Value?

The idea that Bitcoin is a store of value before it's used as a medium of exchange reverses Menger and Mises. Gold became a store of value because it was widely used. Bitcoin must earn this status through demand, not presumption.

### Number Go Up

The NGU meme centers on speculative appreciation, not utility. True money gains value because people use it. Without functional demand, price rises are not sustainable or indicative of monetary adoption.

### Digital Gold

Gold had practical demand long before it became money. Bitcoin lacks non-monetary uses, so must compensate through network effects and adoption. Calling it “digital gold” before that is premature and potentially misleading.

## Conclusion

Money is what people use—not what people declare. It’s the most demanded product, not the most ideologically pure. Whether shells, salt, gold, or Bitcoin, market behavior decides what holds value in exchange.

Bitcoin may become money. But it isn’t there yet. For it to get there, it needs to become more than a slogan or a speculative asset. It needs to be used. Because in the real world, money is earned—one trade at a time.
