# Money as the Most Demanded Product in a Free Market

## The AI TLDR of this document:

- Money isn’t made by governments or magic—it’s just the most popular thing people want to trade for.
- Over time, people figure out what item is easiest to swap, and that thing becomes money.
- Gold became money not because it was shiny, but because it was useful and everyone accepted it.
- Mises said money has to start as something useful before it can be used just for trading.
- Hayek and Selgin showed that if we let different types of money compete, the best one wins—no central bank needed.
- Graeber argued money started with social credit (IOUs), but even then, tokens only mattered if people trusted them.
- Szabo explained that even cavemen liked rare, hard-to-copy collectibles—those were baby money.
- Voskuil says money has no “essence”—if people use it to trade, it’s money; if they don’t, it’s just hype.
- Bitcoin fans often say it’s a “store of value” or “digital gold,” but that only matters if people actually use it.
- So if Bitcoin wants to be real money, it needs less memes and more real-world use—because markets don’t care about slogans.

## Introduction  
Money is often treated as an abstract construct defined by law or authority, but an alternative view rooted in classical and Austrian economics argues that money emerges organically as a market-driven product. In this view, any good that becomes widely demanded and accepted in trade can evolve into money, without requiring top-down decree. This paper explores the idea of money as *the most saleable good* – a commodity prized not for its direct use, but for its superior exchangeability – and examines how this perspective aligns with and challenges various theories of money’s origin and nature. We draw on insights from Carl Menger’s seminal theory of the spontaneous origin of money, Ludwig von Mises’s regression theorem on commodity-based value, F. A. Hayek’s advocacy of currency competition, and George Selgin’s research on free banking. 

We also consider anthropological and heterodox perspectives, such as David Graeber’s debt-based critique of the barter narrative and Nick Szabo’s account of collectibles as proto-money. Finally, we apply these theoretical foundations to modern Bitcoin culture, critiquing popular memes like “store of value,” “number go up,” and “digital gold.” The analysis shows that many of these slogans misunderstand what money fundamentally is: not a static token of wealth or a guaranteed investment, but whatever good the market finds most broadly acceptable in exchange ([The Nature and Origin of Money | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/nature-and-origin-money#:~:text=not%20need%20them%20for%20any,means%20of%20payment%20as%20such)). In a tone that is sharp yet scholarly, we challenge some dogmas of contemporary cryptocurrency discourse while grounding arguments in academic research and historical evidence.

## Theoretical Foundations 

### Carl Menger: Money as the Most Saleable Good  
In his classic essay *On the Origin of Money* (1892), economist Carl Menger argued that money arises not by government design but through the gradual convergence of individuals’ trading behavior. Early economies faced the problem of the “double coincidence of wants” in barter – one person might have a surplus of grain and need shoes, while another has shoes and needs axe heads, etc., and direct swaps often failed to coincide ([On the Origin of Money, by Carl Menger](https://monadnock.net/menger/money.html#:~:text=In%20primitive%20traffic%20the%20economic,clear%20then%2C%20that%20in%20those)) ([On the Origin of Money, by Carl Menger](https://monadnock.net/menger/money.html#:~:text=relatively%20simple%20and%20so%20often,be%20of%20necessity%20left%20undone)). Menger observed that some commodities are easier to trade than others; different goods have “different degrees of saleableness” (marketability) ([On the Origin of Money, by Carl Menger](https://monadnock.net/menger/money.html#:~:text=These%20difficulties%20would%20have%20proved,essential%20causes%20of%20the%20backward)) ([On the Origin of Money, by Carl Menger](https://monadnock.net/menger/money.html#:~:text=of%20the%20saleableness%20of%20goods,saleableness%20of%20commodities%20in%20general)). Rational individuals, he argued, will start accepting highly saleable goods even if they don’t need them, knowing those goods can later be re-traded for something they do need. Over time, the “more saleable” commodities become universally accepted intermediaries of exchange ([The Nature and Origin of Money | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/nature-and-origin-money#:~:text=As%20each%20economizing%20individual%20becomes,exchange%20for%20any%20other%20commodity)). 

Menger gives the example of a smith trading his hard-to-sell armor for cattle – not for consumption, but because cattle were *“the most saleable of all commodities”* in that society, and holding cattle would “multiply his chances” of trading for what he ultimately wanted ([The Nature and Origin of Money | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/nature-and-origin-money#:~:text=In%20the%20times%20of%20which,his%20chances%20of%20finding%20persons)). Through countless such transactions, certain goods (historically, things like cattle, salt, shells, or precious metals) gain nearly universal acceptability. Eventually, these goods are recognized as money – *“acceptable to everyone in trade, and thus capable of being given in exchange for any other commodity”*, as Menger put it ([The Nature and Origin of Money | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/nature-and-origin-money#:~:text=not%20need%20them%20for%20any,means%20of%20payment%20as%20such)). Crucially, this emergence requires no central authority: it is driven by individuals each pursuing their own advantage in exchange. Money, in Menger’s formulation, is simply the commodity with the highest saleability, the one with an “almost unlimited” demand in the market ([On the Origin of Money, by Carl Menger](https://monadnock.net/menger/money.html#:~:text=state%20of%20monetary%20theory,saleableness%20of%20commodities%20in%20general)). This organic process explains why historically diverse societies converged on using certain commodities as money. It also underscores that money’s legitimacy comes *ex post* from market adoption, not *ex ante* from legal proclamation. 

### Ludwig von Mises: Regression Theorem and Commodity Value  
Ludwig von Mises built upon Menger’s insights by addressing a puzzle: how a new money gains value in the first place. His **regression theorem**, presented in *The Theory of Money and Credit* (1912), posits that people can only value a medium of exchange if they have some reference point for its purchasing power in the past ([Mises's Regression Theorem, Bitcoin, and Subjective Value Theory | The Daily Economy](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/misess-regression-theorem-bitcoin-and-subjective-value-theory/#:~:text=reference%20to%20its%20purchasing%20power,by%20introducing%20a%20time%20element)) ([Mises's Regression Theorem, Bitcoin, and Subjective Value Theory | The Daily Economy](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/misess-regression-theorem-bitcoin-and-subjective-value-theory/#:~:text=,of%20a%20medium%20of%20exchange)). This seems circular – money has value because we expect others to accept it, and they accept it because they expect yet others to value it – so Mises “breaks” the apparent circularity by regressing to a time when the item was not used as money. At that earliest point, the good’s value was determined solely by its non-monetary uses ([Mises's Regression Theorem, Bitcoin, and Subjective Value Theory | The Daily Economy](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/misess-regression-theorem-bitcoin-and-subjective-value-theory/#:~:text=,of%20a%20medium%20of%20exchange)). In other words, before a commodity became money, it was demanded for its direct utility (“industrial” or consumption use). Mises wrote that *“when individuals began to acquire objects, not for consumption, but to be used as media of exchange, they valued them according to the objective exchange-value…[the goods] already [had] by reason of their ‘industrial’ usefulness”* ([The Regression Theorem: Practical Applications | AIER](https://aier.org/article/the-regression-theorem-practical-applications/#:~:text=anyone%20accepts%20them%20as%20a,they%20are%20employed%20as%20money)). 

Thus, gold and silver, for example, were prized as ornaments or tools before they ever served as currency; their prior utility gave them an initial value that could bootstrap their monetary use. The regression theorem implies that **commodity monies can emerge naturally** from barter economies because they carry an inherent value into their role as money ([The Regression Theorem: Practical Applications | AIER](https://aier.org/article/the-regression-theorem-practical-applications/#:~:text=Commodity%20monies%20can%20emerge%20naturally,%E2%80%9D%20In%20other%20words%2C%20commodity)) ([The Regression Theorem: Practical Applications | AIER](https://aier.org/article/the-regression-theorem-practical-applications/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20earliest%20value%20of%20money%E2%80%9D,the%20somewhat%20strange%20monies%E2%80%94like%20cigarettes%E2%80%94that)). By contrast, **pure fiat money** – something with no intrinsic or pre-existing value – cannot arise “out of thin air” in a free market ([The Regression Theorem: Practical Applications | AIER](https://aier.org/article/the-regression-theorem-practical-applications/#:~:text=This%20logic%20led%20Mises%20to,%E2%80%9D)). Mises concluded that *“no fiat money could ever come into existence if it did not satisfy this condition”* of a link to previously established value ([The Regression Theorem: Practical Applications | AIER](https://aier.org/article/the-regression-theorem-practical-applications/#:~:text=This%20logic%20led%20Mises%20to,%E2%80%9D)). In practice, fiat currencies historically gained traction either by originally being commodity-backed (e.g. paper notes redeemable for gold or silver) or by government imposition (legal tender laws and tax requirements) that short-circuited the market’s choice. Mises’s analysis reinforces the view that genuine money is not arbitrarily defined by the state; it is anchored in the value that the market had already placed on a good before that good became widely used as a medium of exchange. This insight connects to the idea of money as an evolved product: even as money’s function becomes abstract, its roots trace back to concrete commodities and human valuations. 

### F. A. Hayek: Denationalization and Currency Competition  
Friedrich A. Hayek extended the argument for money’s organic emergence by questioning why governments should monopolize its issuance. In *The Denationalisation of Money* (1976), Hayek advocated allowing private, competing currencies. He argued that money is *“no different from other commodities”* in principle and thus would be better supplied by competition than by state monopoly ([[PDF] Denationalisation of Money: The Argument Refined - Mises Institute](https://cdn.mises.org/Denationalisation%20of%20Money%20The%20Argument%20Refined_5.pdf#:~:text=,by%20competition%20between%20private)). In a system of **competitive currency issuance**, banks or other institutions would issue their own money, and users would be free to choose among them. Hayek predicted that market forces would favor currencies with stable value, driving out poorly managed ones. As one summary of his proposal puts it: Hayek wanted to *“break the government’s monopoly over the issue of currency”*, allowing any private or public body to issue money, which *“would be forced by competition to keep [its] currencies stable”* ([Hayek, private currencies and Zimbabwe — Adam Smith Institute](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/tax-spending/hayek-private-currencies-and-zimbabwe#:~:text=In%201976%2C%20Hayek%20proposed%20that,A%20legal%20tender%20law%20ensures)). In Hayek’s view, issuers of currency, to attract users, would likely peg their notes to a basket of commodities or a standard of value that people trust, thereby limiting inflation ([Hayek, private currencies and Zimbabwe — Adam Smith Institute](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/tax-spending/hayek-private-currencies-and-zimbabwe#:~:text=In%201976%2C%20Hayek%20proposed%20that,A%20legal%20tender%20law%20ensures)). Over time, weaker currencies would lose market share and stronger ones would prevail, possibly converging to one or a few dominant standards ([The Denationalization of Money - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Denationalization_of_Money#:~:text=Friedrich%20Hayek%2C%20and%20published%20in,the%20issue%20of%20their%20notes)). 

The historical record of free banking experiments lends support to Hayek’s theory: periods in which banks operated without central bank monopolies, such as 19th-century Scotland, tended to have stable banking systems and money supply responding to market demand ([Selgin on Free Banking | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/selgin-on-free-banking#:~:text=Lately%2C%20though%2C%20a%20new%20interest,also%20not%20free%20from%20inhibiting)). Research by George Selgin and others finds that **unregulated, decentralized currency systems often worked well**; those that failed were typically hampered by government restrictions, not the absence of them ([Selgin on Free Banking | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/selgin-on-free-banking#:~:text=that%20governments%20are%20more%20fit,to%20those%20of%20central%20banking)). Hayek’s perspective underscores that stable money need not be designed by the state – it can emerge from the discipline of the market. By removing legal barriers to entry in the “money industry,” society might discover better forms of money through trial and error. For Hayek, the spontaneous order of the market, which Adam Smith had shown to efficiently allocate goods, could also determine what is used as money. Money, therefore, should be seen as a competitive product subject to innovation and choice, not a sovereign’s edict. This radically market-oriented view aligns with the notion that the *most demanded* medium will become money: if people trust a private currency more than a government one, they will gravitate to the former, and it will effectively become money regardless of official status. 

### George Selgin: Free Banking and Market-Driven Money Supply  
Monetary economist George Selgin, a leading figure of the modern free banking school, provides further evidence that money and banking can be governed by market principles. In *The Theory of Free Banking* (1988), Selgin argues that when banks are free to issue their own banknotes and liabilities, the **money supply adjusts organically** to meet the economy’s needs, guided by profit-motivated balancing of supply and demand. Under free banking, no single authority dictates the quantity of money; instead, if there is excess money in circulation, banks find their notes being returned for redemption, prompting them to contract issuance, whereas if money is scarce, banks that issue more find their notes in high demand, allowing them to expand ([Free banking - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking#:~:text=Free%20banking%20is%20a%20monetary,those%20applicable%20to%20most%20enterprises)) ([Free banking - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking#:~:text=In%20a%20free%20banking%20system%2C,issued%20by%20a%20%2094)). Market forces thus “control the total quantity of banknotes and deposits” that the system can support with a given reserve of base money ([Free banking - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking#:~:text=regulations%20beyond%20those%20applicable%20to,most%20enterprises)). Historical free banking systems – for instance, in Scotland (1716–1845) or Canada in the 1800s – were notably stable: bank failures were few and inflation modest, in contrast to the frequent crises under more regulated regimes ([Selgin on Free Banking | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/selgin-on-free-banking#:~:text=Lately%2C%20though%2C%20a%20new%20interest,also%20not%20free%20from%20inhibiting)). Selgin’s review of these cases shows that **the least regulated banking systems often performed the best**, while heavily restricted systems fared poorly ([Selgin on Free Banking | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/selgin-on-free-banking#:~:text=that%20governments%20are%20more%20fit,to%20those%20of%20central%20banking)). 

Free banking theory reinforces the concept that money is a *commodity of trade*: banks compete to provide a reliable medium (their notes) and must maintain convertibility (e.g. into gold or other base money) to retain public confidence. This competition acts as a check on inflation and reckless issuance, analogous to how competition in any other industry checks quality. Selgin, following Hayek, notes that for centuries economists treated currency issuance as an exception to the free-market rule, but there is no theoretical reason it must be so ([Selgin on Free Banking | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/selgin-on-free-banking#:~:text=That%20competition%20in%20production%20serves,part%20of%20national%20monetary%20policy)) ([Selgin on Free Banking | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/selgin-on-free-banking#:~:text=Lately%2C%20though%2C%20a%20new%20interest,inquiry%2C%20to%20which%20there%20have)). By treating money as a product, free banking highlights that its value and stability can emerge from decentralized decision-making. If people prefer a certain bank’s notes or a certain form of money, that preference – the demand to hold and accept those notes – is what makes them valuable. Thus, even in the presence of a commodity standard like gold, it was often the competitive banks and mints that refined how money circulated (e.g., producing convenient denominations, ensuring purity of coins, etc., in response to market demand ([Selgin on Free Banking | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/selgin-on-free-banking#:~:text=of%20central%20banks,also%20not%20free%20from%20inhibiting))). 

Selgin’s work underscores a recurring theme: whether it is choosing a monetary metal, a banknote, or a digital token, it is the collective choice of many individuals in voluntary exchange that ultimately **produces “good money”** (money suited to people’s needs) ([Hayek, private currencies and Zimbabwe — Adam Smith Institute](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/tax-spending/hayek-private-currencies-and-zimbabwe#:~:text=In%201976%2C%20Hayek%20proposed%20that,A%20legal%20tender%20law%20ensures)). Any monopolistic or centrally planned control of money, by contrast, runs the risk of ignoring signals from consumers of money – which historically has led to problems like over-issuance (inflation) or suppression of beneficial monetary innovations. In summary, free banking research supports the argument that money, in both its origin and its ongoing management, is grounded in market demand and competition rather than mandate. 

### David Graeber: Debt, Credit, and the Origins of Money  
Not all scholars agree with the purely commodity-driven story of money’s genesis. Anthropologist David Graeber offered a pointed critique of the conventional barter-origin narrative. In *Debt: The First 5,000 Years* (2011), Graeber compiles ethnographic and historical evidence suggesting that **credit systems preceded monetary barter** in many societies ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=Graeber%20argues%20that%20debt%20,no%20credible%20reports%20suggesting%20such)). He notes that in numerous traditional communities, economic exchange was facilitated by webs of IOUs, communal ledgers of favors, and socially enforced obligations – a far cry from the instantaneous barter between strangers posited by economists from Adam Smith to Menger ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=Graeber%20argues%20that%20debt%20,no%20credible%20reports%20suggesting%20such)). According to Graeber, the idea that money emerged directly to solve barter inefficiencies is a “founding myth” of economics, not well supported by anthropological data ([On the Invention of Money – Notes on Sex, Adventure ...](https://davidgraeber.org/articles/on-the-invention-of-money-notes-on-sex-adventure-monomaniacal-sociopathy-and-the-true-function-of-economics/#:~:text=On%20the%20Invention%20of%20Money,of%20the%20gods%20of)) ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=Graeber%20argues%20that%20debt%20,no%20credible%20reports%20suggesting%20such)). 

Instead, he argues, early money more often took the form of a **unit of account for debts**: for example, temple or palace authorities in Mesopotamia defined silver shekels as units to measure debts, even when payments were often made in kind or labor. This aligns with the **“chartalist”** or state theory of money, which holds that money’s value comes from its acceptance for paying taxes or obligations to authorities. Graeber points out that the first recorded use of coins (in Lydia and ancient Greece) appears in contexts of paying soldiers – suggesting that states minted coins to pay armies, and then imposed taxes payable in those coins, forcing the populace to use the new currency ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=indebtedness%20of%20,second%20argument%20follows%20from%20the)) ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=systematic%20state%20violence,1)). In Graeber’s view, **violence and the state** were frequently catalysts for the adoption of money: *“markets are founded and usually maintained by systematic state violence”*, he contends, and only later can markets appear free of these coercive origins ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=of%20money%20%2C%20debt%20is,1)). 

He also emphasizes that *debt* (a promise of future payment) is a more pervasive and longstanding concept than money or barter; informal credit governed exchange in villages, while coinage became important largely in more impersonal contexts or when trust broke down ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=resulting%20amnesty%20came%20to%20be,as%20the%20Law%20of%20Jubilee)) ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=originally%20developed%20as%20means%20of,a%20context%20of%20%2079)). This perspective does not deny that certain commodities became widely used as mediums of exchange, but it implies that **social relations and creditworthiness** were the true “currency” in many periods. Money in the modern sense – anonymous tokens that can be exchanged without trust – might actually be a later development associated with large-scale warfare and economies. What does Graeber’s critique mean for the idea of money as the most demanded product? It complicates it: rather than a simple story of one commodity winning out due to superiority in trade, we see a parallel story of authorities standardizing values to manage debt, sometimes *making* a certain item (like coin or paper) into money by decree. 

Nonetheless, even Graeber acknowledges that once created, coins and currency did begin to circulate according to supply and demand dynamics. The difference is that in his account, the genesis is not purely an “invisible hand” of barter exchange, but a mix of economic and political forces. In reconciling these views, one could say that money’s **market-driven nature** asserts itself over the long run (people ultimately decide what to hold and accept), but the short-run path to a monetary system can be jump-started or steered by institutions and power structures. Graeber’s insights serve as a caution against overly simplistic just-so stories of money’s origin, reminding us that human economies are embedded in social context. For our purposes, his work highlights that even if money *ought* to be seen as an organic market product, historically its adoption has sometimes been entwined with authority – a tension that continues in debates over state vs. cryptocurrency money today.

### Nick Szabo: Collectibles as Proto-Money  
Computer scientist and legal scholar Nick Szabo provides yet another perspective by examining the evolutionary and cultural roots of money. In his essay *Shelling Out: The Origins of Money* (2002), Szabo argues that before formal currencies and coinage, humans developed **“collectibles”** – items valued for their rarity or symbolic significance – which served as a kind of proto-money. These included shells, beads, animal teeth, and other ornaments that were not immediately consumed, but were kept for display, status, or ceremonial exchange. Szabo notes that such collectibles *“were far from arbitrary”* in their characteristics ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=possible%20names%20for%20proto,While%20the%20concrete)). Across cultures, the objects chosen had properties like durability, portability, divisibility, and difficulty to counterfeit – the same properties that later made metals like gold and silver ideal for money ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=possible%20names%20for%20proto,While%20the%20concrete)) ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=objects%20and%20attributes%20valued%20as,as%20money%20as%20we%20moderns)). 

The key function of collectibles, Szabo argues, was as a **store of wealth and a medium of gift exchange**: *“The primary and ultimate evolutionary function of collectibles was as a medium for storing and transferring wealth”* ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=objects%20and%20attributes%20valued%20as,as%20money%20as%20we%20moderns)). In societies without banks or formal contracts, holding a stock of valuable collectibles provided “social credit” and insurance against hard times, as one could trade or gift them to solidify alliances or obtain resources when needed ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=We%20shall%20describe%20how%20collectibles,of%20legal%20judgments%20and%20tribute)) ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=transfer%20even%20possible%20at%20all,and%20exploring%20for%20the%20raw)). Over time, some collectibles became highly “saleable” in Menger’s sense – for example, the shell bead money known as **wampum** among Native Americans was in wide circulation in 17th-century New England, even being declared legal tender by colonial authorities for a period ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=Once%20they%20got%20over%20their,D94)) ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=The%20beginning%20of%20the%20end,by%20Western%20harvesting%20and%20manufacturing)). Wampum strings and belts, initially valued in indigenous prestige economies, evolved into a medium of exchange between natives and European colonists, illustrating an organic transition from collectible to currency. 

Szabo’s research reinforces how *money emerges by evolution, not invention*: just as language evolved from primitive gestures and sounds, money evolved from primitive collectibles and barter objects ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=Institute%20nakamotoinstitute,cooperation%20that%20other%20animals%20cannot)) ([The History and Evolution of Money | by CryptoFemme - Medium](https://medium.com/@cryptofemme/the-history-and-evolution-of-money-a1616d7d50f5#:~:text=The%20History%20and%20Evolution%20of,Shelling%20Out%20by%20Nick%20Szabo)). He even links this to cognitive evolution – humans, unlike Neanderthals, appeared to engage in long-distance trade of collectibles tens of thousands of years ago, suggesting a co-evolution of symbolic thinking, social trust, and proto-monetary behavior ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=match%20at%20L467%20possible%20by,sapiens%20sapiens%20first)) ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=possible%20by%20collectibles,sapiens%20sapiens%20first)). By the time metals and coins appear, they were simply a technological improvement on pre-existing monetary practices (more standardized, durable, and convenient). Szabo’s perspective aligns well with Menger’s: both see money as arising from the cumulative choices of individuals finding certain goods effective in exchange. The difference is largely one of emphasis – Szabo delves into prehistorical and anthropological evidence to show *how* and *why* certain goods became broadly trusted stores of value. This provides a rich backstory to the idea of the most demanded good. It implies that anything serving as money must tap into some existing human desire or need – be it social status, ritual significance, or practical utility – to get off the ground. Money, in this light, was never a purely abstract token; its origins are tangible and tied to human psychology (the desire to collect, to display wealth, to secure future needs). Thus, even as we progress to modern digital forms of money, Szabo’s work suggests that **the same fundamentals apply**: the money that will succeed is that which people *want to hold* and which fulfills social/economic functions better than alternatives. Bitcoin enthusiasts often cite Szabo’s work to draw parallels between ancient collectibles like gold or cowrie shells and the new “digital collectible” that Bitcoin represented in its early days. The implication is that Bitcoin, too, could evolve into widely accepted money if it shares the right traits and garners enough collective trust – a topic we will explore in the context of Bitcoin culture.

### Eric Voskuil: Cryptoeconomics and Non-Essentialist Money  
Contemporary Bitcoin researcher Eric Voskuil approaches the nature of money from a starkly **non-essentialist, market-driven viewpoint**. In his book *Cryptoeconomics: Fundamental Principles of Bitcoin* (2020s), Voskuil emphasizes that “money” is not defined by any intrinsic property or official designation, but solely by *what it does in the market*. In other words, **money is as money does** – if people widely demand and accept an item in exchange, it is money; if they do not, then calling it “money” is a misnomer. Voskuil argues against what he sees as misconceptions in both mainstream and Bitcoin circles about the essence of money. 

One such target is the idea that money is fundamentally a “store of value.” He calls it *“a similar error to assert that money is a store of value”*, clarifying that money’s value **derives entirely from its exchange utility**: *“Money is a store of money. Only objects can actually be stored. The value of money derives entirely from the value of what it can be traded for, to the people trading”* ([](https://voskuil.org/cryptoeconomics/cryptoeconomics.pdf#:~:text=theory%20is%20invalid,unpredictable%20change%2C%20and%20cannot%20be)). This is a direct application of the **subjective theory of value** – value exists in the eye of the beholder, and holding money is only as good as what you expect others will give you for it. Voskuil’s point is that unlike a consumable good (which has inherent usefulness), a currency unit you stash away does not have use in itself; its worth is always contingent on future trade. This line of reasoning leads to a non-essentialist definition: money is not a specific thing (gold, dollars, Bitcoin, shells) by nature – it is any good that people *treat* as a medium of exchange. If tomorrow the market loses confidence in gold or dollars, they would cease to function as money regardless of any formal status. Likewise, if some novel item gains widespread acceptance, it becomes money by that fact alone. Voskuil also dismisses certain “rationalist” distinctions people try to make, such as claiming a hard dividing line between money and non-money. 

For instance, some might say money **must** be a stable store of value or **must** be sanctioned by government, but there are counterexamples: high-inflation currencies still serve as money day-to-day even as they lose value rapidly, and unauthorized monies (like cigarettes in prisons or crypto in some economies) function as money without state backing. What matters is usage and demand. Voskuil’s cryptoeconomic lens is particularly relevant when examining Bitcoin: he critiques many prevalent Bitcoin memes for implicitly assigning Bitcoin an “essence” (digital gold, store of value, etc.) instead of recognizing that Bitcoin will only be money to the extent people actually use it as such. We will delve deeper into those critiques in the next section. For now, the takeaway from Voskuil is that *money emerges from market processes continually*. Even after a currency is established, it retains monetary status only so long as people expect others to honor it. This reinforces our core argument: money is best understood not as a static institution but as the **most marketable good** at a given time ([The Nature and Origin of Money | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/nature-and-origin-money#:~:text=not%20need%20them%20for%20any,means%20of%20payment%20as%20such)). Any unit’s monetary role is always subject to validation (or repudiation) by the collective actions of individuals in the marketplace.

## Bitcoin and the Most Saleable Good: Critiquing Popular Memes  

Having surveyed the theory that money is an organic market product, we turn to the modern phenomenon of Bitcoin. Bitcoin, a decentralized digital asset, burst into public consciousness with grand claims that it would be the future of money. Many proponents explicitly cast Bitcoin in the lineage of commodity monies like gold, invoking the very theories we’ve discussed: they argue Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it the ultimate “saleable good” that the free market will choose as money. 

Indeed, Bitcoin’s rise has been accompanied by a folklore of memes and slogans – **“store of value,” “number go up,” “digital gold,”** among others – which encapsulate beliefs about what Bitcoin is and why it is valuable. While these memes have been effective in promoting Bitcoin’s narrative, they sometimes conflict with the fundamental idea of money as the most saleable good, or misinterpret what that idea entails. In this section, we critically examine a few of the most popular Bitcoin memes through the lens of monetary theory and our foregoing discussion. 

The tone here is deliberately incisive: much of Bitcoin’s culture prides itself on challenging the status quo, yet it has developed its own orthodoxies that warrant scrutiny. By questioning these, we aim to distinguish which aspects of the Bitcoin ethos align with the concept of market-driven money and which are, perhaps, new dogmas under a different guise.

### The “Store of Value” vs. Medium of Exchange Dilemma  
One of Bitcoin’s defining narratives in recent years is that it is a **“store of value” (SoV)** – digital gold 2.0 – even if its use as a daily currency (medium of exchange) remains limited. This meme gained strength especially after Bitcoin’s price rose spectacularly; proponents argued that you should *hold* Bitcoin to preserve and grow wealth over time, much like one would hold gold bars or a savings account. They often cite Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million as a guarantee of long-term scarcity-driven appreciation, contrasting it with inflationary fiat money ([Bitcoin’s 'Store-of-Value' Narrative Is Real but Not a Price Mover | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoins-store-of-value-narrative-is-real-but-not-a-price-mover#:~:text=In%20spite%20of%20its%20short,much%20is%20currently%20in%20existence)) ([Bitcoin’s 'Store-of-Value' Narrative Is Real but Not a Price Mover | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoins-store-of-value-narrative-is-real-but-not-a-price-mover#:~:text=An%20increase%20in%20the%20supply,a%20hedge%20against%20currency%20debasement)). 

However, this emphasis on Bitcoin as a pure store of value, **without it first being widely used in trade, runs contrary to the classical understanding of money’s evolution**. Menger and Mises would remind us that a good cannot reliably act as a store of value unless it is also broadly demanded as a medium of exchange – the causality runs from use in exchange to stable value, not vice versa. Historically, gold and silver became stores of value *because* they were accepted everywhere for transactions (and had prior non-monetary demand); people held them confident that others would accept them, which kept their value relatively stable. By contrast, an asset held only because people expect its price to rise can become a speculative bubble detached from real usage. Voskuil’s critique is salient here: calling something a store of value in itself is misleading, since *“the value of money derives entirely from what it can be traded for”* ([](https://voskuil.org/cryptoeconomics/cryptoeconomics.pdf#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20it%20is%20a%20similar,unpredictable%20change%2C%20and%20cannot%20be)). 

If Bitcoin is not being traded for goods and services in a widespread way, on what basis is its value being measured or “stored”? The store-of-value enthusiasts sometimes retort that Bitcoin is in an adoption phase where it will **first** be a store of value (like “digital gold”) and **later** become a medium of exchange (the so-called “SoV-MoE sequence”). Yet this reverses the historical sequence highlighted by Mises’s regression theorem, which would imply Bitcoin needed some kind of use value to get started. Arguably, Bitcoin did have an initial use case – as a niche medium of exchange for online techies, gamers, and yes, black-market transactions – giving it a foothold of value. But the current SoV narrative downplays usage and focuses on hodling (long-term holding). The risk is a conceptual one: **if everyone simply holds expecting others to eventually use it, who actually uses it in the interim?** The “most saleable good” in a marketplace is the one that moves frequently, not one that sits in cold storage hoping for future sale. There is a circularity dilemma: Bitcoin’s price is high because people think it’s a good store of value, but it will only *be* a good store of value in the long run if it achieves monetary usage and stable demand. Some Bitcoiners acknowledge this and are trying to push merchant adoption, Lightning Network payments, etc., but the dominant meme remains hodling. 

From a critical perspective, the **store-of-value meme may have strayed into dogma**, encouraging a vision of Bitcoin as digital gold bars to hoard, rather than as a fluid currency to trade. This could be seen as a misunderstanding of what made gold valuable as money. Gold’s value was sustained by usage in coins and jewelry; similarly, Bitcoin’s value proposition cannot indefinitely rest on *potential* future use – it must increasingly function as an exchange medium (or at least as highly liquid collateral in finance) to justify the store-of-value label. Otherwise, as Voskuil warns, believing in an asset as a store of value “simply because it hasn’t been around long enough to prove otherwise” is shaky ([Store Of Value vs Payment System - AVC](https://avc.com/2017/08/store-of-value-vs-payment-system/#:~:text=Store%20Of%20Value%20vs%20Payment,and%20importantly%2C%20it%20can)). 

In summary, while Bitcoin *could* become a top-notch store of value, treating that as an article of faith rather than an outcome of widespread saleability is putting the cart before the horse. The critique here is not that Bitcoin is doomed to fail – it is that Bitcoiners should remember that **money’s value comes from use**, and thus work to expand Bitcoin’s actual usage, rather than celebrating an incomplete victory. An asset that people only *wish* others would accept in the future is not yet true money in the present.

### “Number Go Up” – Price Mania vs. Value  
Another pervasive meme in the Bitcoin world is **“Number go up” (NGU)** – a tongue-in-cheek phrase referring to the expectation that Bitcoin’s price in fiat terms will perpetually rise. It’s often used humorously on social media, but it reflects a real mindset: the notion that Bitcoin’s design (especially its programmed scarcity and periodic halvings of supply issuance) practically guarantees an exponential price increase as demand grows. This belief has been a powerful driver of investment, as new entrants are enticed by past charts showing staggering gains and by influencers proclaiming future astronomical targets. 

While optimism is not inherently bad, **NGU borders on a cult mindset** that disconnects price from fundamentals. From a “most saleable good” standpoint, focusing on price appreciation alone is putting effect before cause. If Bitcoin’s “number goes up,” one should ask: *why is it going up?* The healthy answer would be: because more people are using and demanding it (for payments, remittances, a hedge, etc.), i.e. its saleability is increasing. Indeed, early price surges (like 2013’s) correlated with newfound uses (e.g. adoption on darknet markets, or in countries with capital controls). However, later rallies have often been driven by speculative fervor – investors buying because they expect others to buy, a dynamic that resembles a classic bubble or at least a momentum trade. This is not unique to Bitcoin; gold, stocks, and real estate have had speculative phases. But the danger is when speculation becomes the primary narrative. 

**NGU as a meme encourages simplistic buy-and-hold behavior (“number will go up, don’t ask questions”)**, which can blind participants to underlying weaknesses or to the necessity of nurturing real utility. It can also breed complacency and dogmatism: anyone questioning Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation or pointing out volatility risks might be branded a heretic fighting an inevitable law of nature. Yet, no asset’s price rises forever in a straight line; even historically monetized goods like gold saw centuries-long plateaus and crashes. By the logic of our earlier theorists, if Bitcoin fails to deliver practical advantages (or if competitors arise that do better), market demand could stagnate or shift, and then the number can go *down* as fast as up. A focus on continuous appreciation also has sociological consequences in the Bitcoin community. It leads to the rhetoric of “have fun staying poor” directed at skeptics, implying that only fools would not buy in – a sign of triumphalism that can alienate newcomers genuinely trying to understand Bitcoin’s value. More subtly, **the NGU mindset intertwines monetary adoption with an investment proposition** in a way that might be counterproductive. 

If people come to Bitcoin only for profit, will they stick around to use it when profit-taking occurs? True monetary adoption would mean people use Bitcoin because it’s useful to them (censorship-resistant, or low-fee transfers, etc.), not solely because they expect its value to double. Critically, a currency whose chief attraction is that it increases in value may paradoxically *discourage* spending: why use your bitcoin today if it will buy twice as much next year? This is the well-known “deflationary spiral” argument. While often overstated (people will spend if they have needs, regardless of expected appreciation), it underscores a real tension: money’s role is to facilitate exchange, and if everyone is overly incentivized to hoard it, the economy can stagnate. Bitcoin’s high volatility so far actually limits this effect (as prices can swing down, forcing use or sale at times), but the ideal scenario for NGU believers is relentless upward stability – which could entrench a pure hoarding culture. In conclusion, “Number go up” is less an economic principle and more of a marketing mantra. It capitalizes on the truth that increasing demand against fixed supply *should* raise price, but it risks devolving into a self-justifying prophecy. 

For Bitcoin to truly succeed as money, **“utility go up”** should precede “number go up.” That means more users transacting in it because it’s the best tool for the job, not just because it’s a rocket ship asset. A mature Bitcoin economy would celebrate adoption milestones (merchants onboarded, transactions volume growth, technological improvements) as much as price milestones. The critique here, echoing our earlier theorists, is a gentle reminder: value must come from value delivered. If Bitcoin’s price is high, it should correspond to high saleability – otherwise the market can correct painfully. NGU may be a fun meme, but it should not become an unquestioned article of faith overriding rational economic analysis.

### Bitcoin as “Digital Gold” – Metaphor and Misconception  
Perhaps the most rhetorically powerful meme is Bitcoin as **“digital gold.”** This phrase encapsulates many of the ideas above: that Bitcoin is a scarce, precious asset one should hold like gold, as a hedge against inflation and turmoil. It has been repeated by everyone from cryptocurrency enthusiasts to mainstream financial commentators. Even central bankers and Wall Street investors have started acknowledging Bitcoin’s “digital gold” status as its price and popularity have grown. The metaphor is apt in certain respects: Bitcoin’s supply is limited and costly to produce (mining requires work), which draws a parallel to gold’s finite geological supply and mining effort. 

Bitcoin, like gold, is not issued by any government, so it is seen as a stateless form of value. And empirically, we have seen Bitcoin behave somewhat like a risk asset inverse to confidence in fiat: during fears of currency debasement, interest in Bitcoin spikes, similar to gold’s traditional role as a safe haven ([Bitcoin’s Global Rise: From Digital Gold to Cornerstone of a New Economy | by D.H. Jang | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@jangdaehan1/bitcoins-global-rise-from-digital-gold-to-cornerstone-of-a-new-economy-513468b3f7f9#:~:text=Bitcoin%20earned%20the%20nickname%20%E2%80%9Cdigital,This)) ([Bitcoin’s Global Rise: From Digital Gold to Cornerstone of a New Economy | by D.H. Jang | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@jangdaehan1/bitcoins-global-rise-from-digital-gold-to-cornerstone-of-a-new-economy-513468b3f7f9#:~:text=Imagine%20gold%20that%20you%20could,armored%20trucks%20or%20heavy%20vaults)). However, **the “digital gold” narrative can also oversimplify and mislead** if taken too strictly. First, consider that gold’s role as money was not automatic; it was established over millennia. Gold had aesthetic and practical uses (jewelry, ornamentation, later electronics), which helped sustain demand beyond just monetary holding. 

Bitcoin’s “intrinsic value” – as its proponents often admit – is essentially *the network’s security and trustworthiness*, which is a more abstract quality. The Medium article by Jang (2025) enthusiastically claims Bitcoin’s *“intrinsic value comes from decentralized trust: no government can dilute it by printing more”* ([Bitcoin’s Global Rise: From Digital Gold to Cornerstone of a New Economy | by D.H. Jang | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@jangdaehan1/bitcoins-global-rise-from-digital-gold-to-cornerstone-of-a-new-economy-513468b3f7f9#:~:text=scarce%20and%20hard%20to%20produce,year%20head)). This highlights a core belief: Bitcoin’s value is derived from the integrity of its monetary policy and network. That is indeed a strength, but it is a circular one – it assumes what it needs to prove, namely that people want an undilutable asset enough to give it value. Gold’s resistance to inflation was a bonus on top of widespread desirability; Bitcoin’s resistance to inflation is arguably its primary selling point, which means its value proposition is tied strongly to people’s ideological preference for limited supply. Many do have that preference, especially after the 2008 financial crisis and recent monetary expansions, but it is not universal. The “digital gold” analogy may therefore be **premature**: Bitcoin as it stands today is more volatile and less universally accepted than gold. Gold has a 5,000-year track record of value; Bitcoin has 15 years. 

Advocates counter that Bitcoin is catching up in the “popularity contest” quickly ([Bitcoin’s Global Rise: From Digital Gold to Cornerstone of a New Economy | by D.H. Jang | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@jangdaehan1/bitcoins-global-rise-from-digital-gold-to-cornerstone-of-a-new-economy-513468b3f7f9#:~:text=Bitcoin%20as%20a%20hedge%20against,armored%20trucks%20or%20heavy%20vaults)), but from a monetary-evolution standpoint, Bitcoin is still in an early experimental phase. Treating it exactly like gold might ignore practical differences: for example, gold doesn’t rely on an electric grid and internet to exist, whereas Bitcoin does – this introduces different risk factors (cybersecurity, infrastructure dependence) that gold never had. Another misconception can arise in how people interpret “digital gold”: some may think it means Bitcoin’s destiny is to *replace* gold or that it must have a comparable market capitalization to be fairly valued. These assumptions drive predictions that Bitcoin will 10x or more (since gold’s market cap is around $12 trillion and Bitcoin’s is under $1 trillion as of 2025). While it’s possible, it isn’t guaranteed by any economic law – gold’s market cap is that high in part because of central bank reserves and jewelry demand in addition to investment demand. Bitcoin lacks those two sources (central banks do not hold it in reserve at this time, and it’s obviously not wearable), so its “ceiling” could be different. Moreover, **if Bitcoin truly became as stable as gold, it might lose some of its speculative appeal that fuels NGU**. 

Gold’s price doesn’t typically triple in a year; Bitcoin’s has, partly because it’s not fully monetized or stabilized yet. There is an irony that some Bitcoiners want it both ways: to be as stable and universally accepted as gold, yet also to keep delivering huge gains. In a fully mature state, you usually can’t have both – money that is widely considered a safe store tends to have low returns (essentially just tracking inflation or modestly increasing). A related meme in Bitcoin is “Bitcoin fixes this,” implying that adopting Bitcoin will solve issues like fiat inflation, poor savings returns, etc. This overlaps with the digital gold notion: if only everyone switched to Bitcoin (a “hard” money), economies would flourish without the distortions of central bank policy. This is reminiscent of older hard-money arguments (e.g. the gold standard’s purported discipline). While there is theoretical merit to some of these claims (excessive money printing can cause harm, and a rules-based currency might constrain that), there is also a risk of glossing over trade-offs. A rigid gold standard historically led to painful deflations and constrained monetary responses to crises; a Bitcoin standard could have similar or new challenges (such as high default risk in contracts if currency value swings, or liquidity crunches if many hoard coins). 

In essence, “digital gold” is a powerful narrative because it piggybacks on gold’s legitimacy, but it can also become a shield against critical evaluation: one might assume Bitcoin has already proven itself like gold has. A more nuanced stance is: Bitcoin *aspires* to be digital gold, and is on a path that could make it so, but it hasn’t yet achieved the breadth of acceptance or the stability that gold has. True to the free-market view of money, Bitcoin will attain “digital gold” status not by decree or by meme magic, but by the gradual, perhaps invisible, hand of the market endorsing it. This means more people in more countries deciding to use Bitcoin when given a choice – not because they’re told it’s digital gold, but because they actually find it more convenient or reliable than alternatives. We are seeing glimmers of this (from Lightning payments in emerging markets to companies holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset), but also setbacks (regulatory crackdowns, competing cryptocurrencies, etc.). The *critique of the meme* is thus: don’t let the catchy slogan blind you to the work still needed. If Bitcoin maximalists truly want Bitcoin to be the world’s reserve money, they should heed Hayek’s and Selgin’s lessons – encourage competition and demonstrate Bitcoin’s superiority in practice, rather than assuming an inevitable victory. Money, as the most saleable good, is an emergent phenomenon; Bitcoin has to continuously earn that title in the face of technological and economic competition. If it does, the digital gold moniker will be justified by outcomes, not just assertions.

## Conclusion  
The notion that “money is the most demanded product in a free market” offers a unifying lens through which to view both the ancient origins of currency and the cutting edge of cryptocurrency. From Carl Menger’s 19th-century insight about more saleable commodities naturally becoming media of exchange ([The Nature and Origin of Money | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/nature-and-origin-money#:~:text=not%20need%20them%20for%20any,means%20of%20payment%20as%20such)) to Eric Voskuil’s 21st-century reminder that money’s value rests on human preferences and not on any imposed essence ([](https://voskuil.org/cryptoeconomics/cryptoeconomics.pdf#:~:text=theory%20is%20invalid,unpredictable%20change%2C%20and%20cannot%20be)), the theme is consistent: money emerges, evolves, and survives by virtue of the *collective choices of individuals*. It is not an ethereal social contract given value by words alone, nor merely a token of state power, but an organic product of economic interaction. This perspective does not dismiss the role of laws, institutions, or even memes – they can all influence which goods gain monetary status – but ultimately, no law or meme can make something money if people do not actually use and desire it.

Our exploration integrated diverse viewpoints. Menger and Mises showed how money can start as a useful good and become a general medium through iterative barter and the memory of value ([The Regression Theorem: Practical Applications | AIER](https://aier.org/article/the-regression-theorem-practical-applications/#:~:text=anyone%20accepts%20them%20as%20a,they%20are%20employed%20as%20money)) ([The Regression Theorem: Practical Applications | AIER](https://aier.org/article/the-regression-theorem-practical-applications/#:~:text=This%20logic%20led%20Mises%20to,%E2%80%9D)). Hayek and Selgin illustrated that even modern monetary systems work best when competition and market signals are allowed to operate, treating currency like a good that firms compete to provide ([Hayek, private currencies and Zimbabwe — Adam Smith Institute](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/tax-spending/hayek-private-currencies-and-zimbabwe#:~:text=In%201976%2C%20Hayek%20proposed%20that,A%20legal%20tender%20law%20ensures)) ([Selgin on Free Banking | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/selgin-on-free-banking#:~:text=Lately%2C%20though%2C%20a%20new%20interest,also%20not%20free%20from%20inhibiting)). Graeber added depth by documenting that human economies also run on credit and trust, meaning that what becomes “most demanded” is often shaped by social context and sometimes coercion ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=of%20money%20%2C%20debt%20is,1)) ([Debt: The First 5,000 Years - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years#:~:text=Graeber%20argues%20that%20debt%20,no%20credible%20reports%20suggesting%20such)). Szabo took us back to prehistory, implying that the precursors of money were already being selected for their saleability and ability to transfer value across time ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=objects%20and%20attributes%20valued%20as,as%20money%20as%20we%20moderns)) ([Shelling Out: The Origins of Money | Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/shelling-out/#:~:text=collectibles%20was%20as%20a%20medium,as%20money%20as%20we%20moderns)). These perspectives, rather than contradicting each other, can be seen as different layers of the monetary phenomenon – material, political, cultural – all of which converge in the money we use.

In applying this framework to Bitcoin, we found both alignment and friction. On one hand, Bitcoin’s very birth was a kind of spontaneous order: an anonymous inventor released open-source code, and a network grew because people chose to run it and ascribe value to its token. No state decreed Bitcoin into existence; it *organically* accumulated a price as a digital collectible and medium among a small circle, then a larger circle, and so on – a process much like Menger’s cattle or shells, but in cyberspace. Bitcoin’s success to date is a testament to the free-market view of money: it became valuable through voluntary adoption and consensus of its users, essentially because it proved *saleable* (one could find buyers) even when it was a curiosity. 

On the other hand, the Bitcoin community’s tendency to craft semi-mythological narratives (“immaculate conception” of the coin, destinies of hyper-bitcoinization, etc.) sometimes veers into the territory of believing that technology or ideology alone guarantees monetary status. Our critique of memes like “store of value” and “digital gold” was not to deny Bitcoin’s potential as either, but to stress that these are *titles to be earned through market processes*, not merely asserted. Money can be many things – a unit of account, a store of purchasing power, a symbol of social trust – but above all, it is what people will trade for goods and services. If Bitcoin advocates keep that principle front and center, they are more likely to focus on improving Bitcoin’s usability, scalability, and actual adoption, rather than resting on slogans. In doing so, they would be following the pragmatic, anti-dogmatic spirit exemplified by thinkers like Hayek (who welcomed competition and did not presume any one form of money to be inevitably supreme) ([Selgin on Free Banking | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/selgin-on-free-banking#:~:text=Lately%2C%20though%2C%20a%20new%20interest,inquiry%2C%20to%20which%20there%20have)).

In academic and policy debates, this market-driven view of money challenges both the extremes of statist and crypto-utopian thinking. It rejects the notion that money’s value comes solely from government fiat; history shows many episodes of valuable monies that were outside or even against official currency (from medieval trade coins to contemporary cryptocurrencies). At the same time, it cautions crypto enthusiasts that one cannot simply code a perfect money in isolation from economic reality – any new money must bootstrap itself via the goods and services people are willing to exchange for it. Bitcoin’s ongoing experiment will ultimately be judged by this standard: Does it mature into a widely used transaction medium and unit of account, beyond being a volatile investment? Or will it settle into a digital niche akin to a collectible or a “crypto gold” held by a subset as a hedge? The answer will be determined by the choices of millions of individuals, each pursuing their own interest – exactly the process by which any money in history has either thrived or faded.

In conclusion, viewing money as an organic product – the most saleable good – provides both explanatory power and a reality check. It explains why gold outlasted countless fiat currencies, why cigarettes could become money in POW camps, and why Bitcoin, against many odds, climbed from valueless bytes to a global financial phenomenon. It also reminds us that the status of being money is not a birthright; it is constantly subject to competitive pressures and human judgments of value. This perspective encourages openness to monetary innovation (since better monies can emerge) while keeping us skeptical of grandiose claims (since no money is immune to market laws). As John Civic (BitcoinErrorLog) might put it in a sharp aside: the free market is ruthlessly effective at cutting through hype. In the end, the money that endures will be that which people find most convenient, reliable, and broadly acceptable – not because an economist theorized it, a government mandated it, or a meme advertised it, but because it proved itself in the “global test” of trade ([The Nature and Origin of Money | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/nature-and-origin-money#:~:text=not%20need%20them%20for%20any,means%20of%20payment%20as%20such)). Bitcoin or any other contender will be no exception.
